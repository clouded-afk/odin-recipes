        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>True Italian-made salami is not available to everyone outside of Italy, but many domestic versions are excellent, especially if you buy from a shop that makes its own. For a pasta sauce, try the southern-style cacciatorini, soppressata or Genoa-style salami. Many varieties come in a mild or spicy version. Taste a piece to make sure you like its flavor. Salami is best in a pasta sauce when cooked only briefly, so add it in the final minutes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little more for drizzling</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>14 plum tomatoes, medium diced</li>
                <li>A splash of dry white wine</li>
                <li>1 lb. of Rigatoni</li>
                <li>1/4 lb. chunk salami, cut into small cubes</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 lb. mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes</li>
                <li>1 bunch arugla, remove stems</li>
                <li>1 cup grated pecorino romano cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large fry pan over medium-low heat, warm the 1/4 cup olive oil. Add the garlic and saut√© until it is very lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, increase the heat to medium and cook until the tomatoes begin to release their juices, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the white wine and let it boil away for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the boiling water, add the pasta and cook until al dente (tender but firm to the bite), 12 to 14 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the salami to the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.
                </li>
                <li>Drain the pasta well and put it in a warmed large, shallow bowl. Add the tomato sauce and toss. Add the mozzarella, arugula and a generous drizzle of olive oil and toss gently. Add a handful of the pecorino cheese and toss. Serve immediately. Pass the remaining pecorino cheese at the table.</li>
