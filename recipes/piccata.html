        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This easy Italian dish is a favorite of many busy cooks, since pounding boneless, skinless chicken breasts into tender cutlets mean they will cook quickly in a frypan. A flavorful pan sauce, bright with lemon juice and capers, is prepared in the same pan, making cleanup a breeze, too.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>Kosher Salt</li>
                <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 Tbs. olive oil</li>
                <li>3 Tbs. unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 Tbs. minced shallot</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>3 Tbs. fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 Tbs. drained capers</li>
                <li>2 Tbs. fresh minced parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Butterfly the chicken breasts and cut them in half. Working with one chicken breast half at a time, place the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and, using a meat pounder or other heavy, flat object, gently pound to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch (6 mm).</li>
                <li>Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and dredge the chicken in it. Shake off the excess.</li>
                <li>In the nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Place 2 pieces of chicken in the pan and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter or individual plates. Warm the remaining 1 Tbs. oil in the pan and repeat to brown the remaining chicken.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and melt 1 Tbs. of the butter in the pan. Add the shallot and cook until softened and golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add the wine, lemon juice and broth, increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the liquid is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the remaining 2 Tbs. butter, the capers and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the sauce over the chicken and pass any remaining sauce alongside. Serve immediately. Serves 4.</li>
