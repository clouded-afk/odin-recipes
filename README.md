In this project I will create a website about recipes using HTML. Later this will be expanded upon using CSS and JS, but for now I will strictly use HTML to build the foundation of the website, as well as using git to stage and commit files into my GitHub repository for version control.

### During the project I demonstrated the following:

    - using command line to stage and commit files to my repository as meaningful changes were made to the code
    - practiced creating good commit messages so others can understand the different changes I made
    - implementing the html boilerplate on the main page, as well as the linked web pages
    - adding images to the pages, sourcing them from a different folder in the directory
    - using relative links to access the different pages from the main page
    - using headers to separate the different sections of content, as well as paragraphs to write text for the page
    - using lists, both ordered and unordered for certain sections of the pages
